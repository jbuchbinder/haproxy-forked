 *                             the request being processed or parsed. Reset to
 *                             zero during accept(), and changes while parsing
 *                             chunks.
 *  - eoh (End of Headers)   : relative offset in the buffer of first byte that
 *                             is not part of a completely processed header.
 *                             During parsing, it points to last header seen
 *                             for states after START. When in HTTP_MSG_BODY,
 *                             eoh points to the first byte of the last CRLF
 *                             preceeding data.
 *  - col and sov            : When in HTTP_MSG_BODY, will point to the first
 *                             byte of data (relative to buffer).
 *  - sol (start of line)    : start of line, also start of message when fully parsed.
 *  - eol (End of Line)      : relative offset in the buffer of the first byte
 *                             which marks the end of the line (LF or CRLF).
 * Note that all offsets are relative to the beginning of the buffer. To get
 * them relative to the current request, subtract ->som or ->sol.
