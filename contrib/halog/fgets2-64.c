	 * default. The principle is that a zero byte is the only one which
	 * will cause a 1 to appear on the upper bit of a byte/word/etc... when
	 * we subtract 1. So we can detect a zero byte if a one appears at any
	 * of the bits 7, 15, 23 or 31 where it was not. It takes only one
	 * instruction to test for the presence of any of these bits, but it is
	 * still complex to check for their initial absence. Thus, we'll
	 * proceed differently : we first save and clear only those bits, then
	 * we check in the final result if one of them is present and was not.
