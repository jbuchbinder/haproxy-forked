HAPROXY API
===========

REST-type API to expose haproxy administration and stats.

If haproxy is compiled with "-DUSE_API=1", it will enable this interface,
which is located at $STATSURL/api/$COMMAND

The list of possible values for $COMMAND are listed below.

"pool.add" command
------------------

Dynamically add a server to a proxy. Takes a single argument, a URL encoded
JSON string.

Example:
	http://localhost:60081/api/pool.add/%7B%22proxy%22%3A%22appli1-rewrite%22%2C%22server%22%3A%22xyz%22%2C%22addr%22%3A%22192.168.6.66%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Afalse%2C%22port%22%3A8080%7D

Which is a URL encoded version of:
	{"proxy":"appli1-rewrite","server":"xyz","addr":"192.168.6.66","disabled":false,"port":8080}

Possible keys are:

	proxy (string) - Destination proxy
	server (string) - Descriptive name of server
	addr (string) - Destination IP
	disabled (bool) - Whether this will be initially disabled
	port (int) - Destination port
	check (bool) - Whether to perform health checks or not
	check_addr (string) - Optional address to use for health checks
	check_port (int) - Optional port to use for health checks
	inter (int) - Check interval in ms
	rise (int) - Time in iterations to come up
	fall (int) - Time in iterations to come down
	weight (int) - Initial load balancing weight

"pool.remove" command
----------------------

Takes two arguments, proxy and server. Removes a server from a proxy
permanently.

(DOES NOT WORK AT THE MOMENT, DON'T USE)

"pool.disable" command
----------------------

Takes two arguments, proxy and server. Puts a server in "maintenance" mode.

"pool.enable" command
---------------------

Takes two arguments, proxy and server. Removes a server from "maintenance"
mode.

"pool.status" command
---------------------

Takes two arguments, proxy and server. Gets status for server.

"pool.contents" command
-----------------------

Takes one argument, proxy. Gets status for all servers in a proxy.

"version" command
-----------------

This command takes no arguments, and returns the version of the API
being served/supported by haproxy. This is completely arbitrary, and
should/will change any time something seriously breaking comes along.
If you pass nothing after api/, you'll probably get this.

EXAMPLES
========

With the examples/haproxy.api.cfg config file....

	http://localhost:60081/api/pool.status/appli4-backup/inst2

would give the status of server inst2 in pool appli4-backup,

	http://localhost:60081/api/pool.disable/appli4-backup/inst2

would "disable" the server (put it in maintenance mode), and

	http://localhost:60081/api/pool.enable/appli4-backup/inst2

would "enable" the server (remove it from maintenance mode).
